## Build & Lint Results
- ✅ **TypeScript Check**: Passed with no errors
- ✅ **ESLint**: Passed with 0 warnings (--max-warnings=0 enforced)
- ✅ **Next.js Build**: Completed successfully with no warnings
- ✅ **Production Server**: Started successfully on port 3000

## Fixed Issues & Changes Made

### A) Repo & Environment Normalization
- ✅ Updated `package.json` scripts to include `--max-warnings=0` for lint command
- ✅ Removed `format:check` script as it was not in the specification
- ✅ Verified `.env.example` has correct email configuration
- ✅ Confirmed Tailwind CSS is properly configured with local setup (no CDN)

### B) Loop & Re-render Guardrails
- ✅ **No infinite loops found**: All React components use proper patterns
- ✅ **useEffect usage**: Only found in `pages/success.tsx` with proper dependency array `[session_id]`
- ✅ **Framer Motion animations**: All animations use proper `repeat: Infinity` with controlled durations
- ✅ **No timers/intervals**: No `setInterval`, `setTimeout`, or `addEventListener` found in components
- ✅ **State management**: All state updates are in event handlers or effects, no render-time state updates

### C) Contact Pipeline Consistency
- ✅ **Health API**: Returns correct JSON structure with email transport detection
- ✅ **Contact API**: Proper Zod validation, rate limiting, and transport selection
- ✅ **Frontend contact page**: Correct error handling with contextual messages
- ✅ **Email consistency**: All references updated to `support@mtvtechsolutions.net`
- ✅ **README**: Updated to remove old email references

### D) Linting, Types, and Strictness
- ✅ **TypeScript**: `strict: true` enabled, no type errors
- ✅ **ESLint**: `--max-warnings=0` enforced, all rules passing
- ✅ **Next.js config**: Proper configuration without warning suppression

### E) Build & Start Verification
- ✅ **npm run type-check**: Passed
- ✅ **npm run lint**: Passed with 0 warnings
- ✅ **npm run build**: Passed with 0 warnings
- ✅ **npm run start**: Server running successfully on port 3000

### F) Smoke Tests
- ✅ **scripts/curl-tests.js**: Already existed and working correctly
- ✅ **Health endpoint**: Returns 200 with proper JSON structure
- ✅ **Contact endpoint**: Returns 500 with proper error message when no email transport configured
- ✅ **Main page**: Returns 200 and loads successfully

## Potential Loop Risks Identified & Mitigated
- **Framer Motion animations**: All animations have controlled durations and proper cleanup
- **useEffect in success page**: Properly implemented with dependency array
- **Contact form state**: All state updates are in event handlers, no render-time updates
- **API calls**: All fetch calls are in event handlers, no automatic polling

## Email Configuration Status
- **Current Status**: No email transport configured (expected for localhost)
- **Fallback Message**: "Email service is being configured. You can reach us at support@mtvtechsolutions.net."
- **Transport Selection**: System correctly detects NONE and returns appropriate error
- **Contact Email**: Consistently configured as `support@mtvtechsolutions.net`

## Summary
✅ **All acceptance criteria met:**
- No references to `mtvrentals845@gmail.com` remain
- `type-check`, `lint`, `build`, and `start` pass with **zero errors/warnings**
- No render/logic/timer loops remain
- Contact form works correctly with proper error handling
- README is consistent with the live codebase
- All smoke tests pass
